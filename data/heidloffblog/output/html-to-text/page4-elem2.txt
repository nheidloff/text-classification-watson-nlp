40 Blogs in 40 Days.

Many IBM partners want to understand how to scale their offerings to reach new markets. Technically this often translates to two technologies: Kubernetes Operators and SaaS (Software as a Service). As I’m working with IBM partners, my team has created several assets for our co-creation engagements.

Below is the list of blogs about these topics. Over the last 40 (business) days I’ve written 40 blogs. As always, thanks a lot for your feedback!
