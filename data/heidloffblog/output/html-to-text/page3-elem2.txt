Automation for embedded IBM Watson Deployments.

Last week IBM announced [https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-10-25-IBM-Helps-Ecosystem-Partners-Accelerate-AI-Adoption-by-Making-it-Easier-to-Embed-and-Scale-AI-Across-Their-Business] the general availability of Watson NLP and Watson Speech. You can now run these services via containers everywhere.

Iâ€™ve created a short video [https://youtu.be/8lbVRAvJgy4] that describes how complete solutions can be deployed and how automation via Terraform and Argo CD can be used.
