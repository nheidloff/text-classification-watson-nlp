Pictures from OOP in Munich. <p>This week I attended OOP in Munich, Germany, which is a conference with 2300 attendees. My colleagues and I presented and demonstrated the IBM Cloud. Below are some pictures. The IBM team: Ansgar&#8217;s and my session: When to use Serverless? When to use Kubernetes? Demo at our booth: Visual Recognition for Anki Cozmo with TensorFlow [&#8230;]</p>
