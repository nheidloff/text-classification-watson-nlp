IBM Build Labs helps IBM partners to scale their businesses and to reach new markets.
I am very proud that our team has produced two reference architectures to accomplish this:
* Kubernetes Operators Reference Architecture [https://github.com/ibm/operator-sample-go]
* Software as a Service (SaaS) Reference Architecture [https://github.com/IBM/multi-tenancy]
This short video gives you more context.
