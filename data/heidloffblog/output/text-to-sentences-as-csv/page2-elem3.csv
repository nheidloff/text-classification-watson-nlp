page2-elem3,The new Watson Assistant is awesome.
page2-elem3,IBM Watson Assistant is a SaaS offering from IBM to build conversational user experiences.
page2-elem3,The first version was already good but the new(ish) version is just awesome!
page2-elem3,Over the last years Watson Assistant has successfully been used by many IBM clients and partners.
page2-elem3,Based on the feedback from clients the IBM development and design team has created a brand new experience.
page2-elem3,This second version was released at the end of 2021.
page2-elem3,I was only able to try it recently and was positively surprised how much the offering has evolved.
page2-elem3,Below are some of my highlights.
page2-elem3,1.
page2-elem3,Actions
page2-elem3,The new Watson Assistant uses a more natural way to define conversations.
page2-elem3,The old ‘dialog’ experience was replaced with a more intuitive concept which is more goal oriented.
page2-elem3,For example Assistant users don’t use intents anymore but actions.
page2-elem3,Intents still exist internally but users want to define actions so that end users can reach their goals.
page2-elem3,Similarly Assistant users don’t have to define entities anymore.
page2-elem3,Again they still exist internally but as far as users are concerned they just define types (e.g. free text) in the actions experience and the entities are created automatically.

page2-elem3,Integration of Watson Discovery
page2-elem3,With the Assistant the most typical conversation flows are covered.
page2-elem3,However for advanced topics Assistant can call out to other services like Watson Discovery.
page2-elem3,This is useful if you have FAQs or other data stored in other systems that you want to expose to end users.
page2-elem3,The following screenshot shows how Assistant can return articles from my blog.
page2-elem3,It only takes five minutes to implement this.

page2-elem3,Getting started
page2-elem3,To get started try it out yourselves.
page2-elem3,There is a free lite plan [https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant].
