Setting up IBM Software with Terraform.
Automation is key when developing and deploying software.
Community is key to get support, to find samples and more.
This is why I like Terraform which is a great tool to automate infrastructure on any cloud and there is a huge community.
Infrastructure as Code
While developers have used source control systems for a long time, more and more DevOps engineers use the same mechanism to deploy and manage infrastructures.
The main advantage of handling infrastructure as code is that with a declarative approach changes can be easier tracked and human errors can be reduced.
Over the last years Terraform [https://www.terraform.io/] has gained popularity and became an established tool to set up infrastructure.
Getting started with Terraform
I’d like to blog soon more about Terraform.
Here are some resources that I have used to learn it.
* Terraform [https://www.terraform.io/]

* 8 Terraform Best Practices that will improve your TF workflow immediately [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxPykhPxRW0]

Terraform for IBM Software
IBM provides a lot of modules to deploy IBM Software.
* IBM Cloud Provider [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs]
* IBM Cloud modules [https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/documentation]
* IBM Cloud Native Toolkit modules [https://github.com/orgs/cloud-native-toolkit/repositories]
* Getting started with Terraform on IBM Cloud [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started]
Here is a little sample to deploy a resource group in the IBM Cloud and a namespace in a Kubernetes cluster.
