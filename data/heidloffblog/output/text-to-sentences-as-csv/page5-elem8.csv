page5-elem8,Defining Dependencies in Kubernetes Operators.
page5-elem8,Operators can automate the deployment and operations of custom Kubernetes resources.
page5-elem8,These resources might dependent on other third party resources.
page5-elem8,This article describes how to define these dependencies.
page5-elem8,I’m working on a sample [https://github.com/nheidloff/operator-sample-go] that describes different patterns and best practices to build operators with Golang.
page5-elem8,The repo demonstrates how a custom resource ‘Application’ uses internally a third party ‘Database’ resource which is managed by another controller.
page5-elem8,This is a simplified version of the typical scenario to use a managed database in the cloud.
page5-elem8,Read my previous blog [http://heidloff.net/article/accessing-third-party-custom-resources-go-operators/] that explains how to access third party resources in controllers’ Go code.
page5-elem8,Additionally you need to ensure that the dependent operator (in my sample the database operator) exists when an operator (in my sample the application operator) is deployed.
page5-elem8,This can be done in the cluster service version (CSV).
page5-elem8,The CSV is the operator bundle/package which contains the definition of a specific operator version.
page5-elem8,Here is the CSV [https://github.com/nheidloff/operator-sample-go/blob/1280fe242726a329642a6a3950d1a8b9990e14d0/operator-application/bundle/manifests/operator-application.clusterserviceversion.yaml#L26-L38] of the application operator.
page5-elem8,The dependency is defined in the ‘required’ section of the spec.
page5-elem8,apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
page5-elem8,kind: ClusterServiceVersion
page5-elem8,spec:
page5-elem8,apiservicedefinitions: {}
page5-elem8,customresourcedefinitions:
page5-elem8,owned:
page5-elem8,- displayName: Application
page5-elem8,kind: Application
page5-elem8,name: applications.application.sample.ibm.com
page5-elem8,version: v1alpha1
page5-elem8,required:
page5-elem8,- displayName: Database
page5-elem8,kind: Database
page5-elem8,name: databases.database.sample.third.party
page5-elem8,version: v1alpha1
page5-elem8,When you try to deploy the application operator but the database operator doesn’t exist you get an error.
