page3-elem8,Automation is key when developing and deploying software.
page3-elem8,Community is key to get support to find samples and more.
page3-elem8,This is why I like Terraform which is a great tool to automate infrastructure on any cloud and there is a huge community.
page3-elem8,Infrastructure as Code
page3-elem8,While developers have used source control systems for a long time more and more DevOps engineers use the same mechanism to deploy and manage infrastructures.
page3-elem8,The main advantage of handling infrastructure as code is that with a declarative approach changes can be easier tracked and human errors can be reduced.
page3-elem8,Over the last years Terraform [https://www.terraform.io/] has gained popularity and became an established tool to set up infrastructure.
